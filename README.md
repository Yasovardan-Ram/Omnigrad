## 📖 Overview

**OmniGrad** is an educational desktop application that demonstrates how feedforward neural networks work internally.

Rather than relying on machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, OmniGrad implements a **custom scalar automatic differentiation engine** and a complete **multilayer perceptron (MLP)** from scratch.

The project combines these core concepts with a modern desktop interface built using **CustomTkinter**, allowing users to experiment with network architectures, train models interactively, visualize computation graphs, and observe how predictions improve over time.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yasovardan-Ram/Omnigrad.git
cd Omnigrad
```

---

### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Install Graphviz

OmniGrad uses **Graphviz** to generate computation graphs.

Download Graphviz from:

https://graphviz.org/download/

Install it using the default installer.

---

### 4. Add Graphviz to PATH (Windows)

Locate your Graphviz installation.

Typical location:

```
C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin
```

Open

```
System Properties
→ Advanced
→ Environment Variables
```

Under **System Variables**, edit **Path** and add:

```
C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin
```

Restart your terminal afterwards.

Verify the installation:

```bash
dot -V
```

You should see something similar to:

```
dot - graphviz version ...
```

---

### 5. Run OmniGrad

```bash
python main.py
```

# 🙏 Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by **Micrograd** by **Andrej Karpathy**.

Micrograd demonstrates how automatic differentiation and neural networks can be implemented in a surprisingly small amount of Python code.

OmniGrad expands on those educational ideas by providing an interactive desktop application featuring visualization, training utilities, computation graphs, and a graphical user interface.
